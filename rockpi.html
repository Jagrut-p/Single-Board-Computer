            <br><b><i>The Raspberry Pi Foundation was established in 2008 by a group including Eben Upton, in
                    response to a noticeable decline in both the number and skill level of students applying to study
                    computer science University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory. The foundation's goal was to create a
                    low-cost computer to help rekindle interest in programming among schoolchildren. <br><br>

                    This mission was inspired by the aims of the BBC Micro computer of the early 1980s, which was
                    developed by Acorn Computers as part of a BBC initiative to promote computer literacy in UK
                    schools. The names "Model A" and "Model B" were chosen as a deliberate homage to the BBC
                    Micro. The name "Raspberry Pi" combines the fruit-themed naming convention used by early computer
                    companies with a nod to the Python programming language.</i></b>
