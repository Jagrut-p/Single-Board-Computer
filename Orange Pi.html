            <hr><i><b>Orange Pi is a series of cost effective single-board computers (SBC) designed and manufactured by
                    Shenzhen
                    Xunlong Software Co., Ltd. The technical specifications of Orange Pi boards vary between models.
                    Orange Pi
                    OS, based on Arch Linux, is the officially supported operating system for Orange Pi boards. However,
                    the boards are compatible with other
                    operating systems based on the Linux kernel such as Android. Orange Pi is also a main competitor of
                    Raspberry Pi and their SBCs. <br> The first model of Orange Pi was released in 2014. Thirty other
                    models have been launched since. In 2022, Orange Pi OS was released. It, by default, comes
                    with the Arch Linux operating system, however
                    there are two other versions: Orange Pi OS Droid (mainly used in desktop applications), Orange Pi OS
                    Arch
                    (mainly used in lightweight applications), and Orange Pi OS OH (mainly used for CLI-centered
                    applications). The modern Orange Pi boards are also compatible with third-party operating systems,
                    like Debian, Ubuntu and
                    Android. Orange Pi also partners with companies and higher education systems internationally,
                    such as UCDavis, Oviton
                    Technologie GmbH, and Makerlab Electronics.</b></i>
