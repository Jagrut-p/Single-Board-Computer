        <font size="4"> <i> <b>A single-board computer (SBC) is a complete computer built on a single circuit board, with
                    microprocessor(s),
                    memory, input/output (I/O) and other features required of a functional computer. Single-board
                    computers are
                    commonly made as demonstration or development systems, for educational systems, or for use as
                    embedded computer
                    controllers. Many types of home computers or portable computers integrate all their functions onto a
                    single
                    printed circuit board. <br><br>

                    Unlike a desktop personal computer, single-board computers often do not rely on expansion slots for
                    peripheral
                    functions or expansion. Single-board computers have been built using a wide range of
                    microprocessors. Simple
                    designs, such as those built by computer hobbyists, often use static RAM and low-cost 32- or 64-bit
                    processors
                    like ARM. Other types, such as blade servers, would perform similar to a server computer, only in a
                    more compact
                    format. <br><br>

                    A computer-on-module is a type of single-board computer made to plug into a carrier board,
                    baseboard, or
                    backplane for system expansion.</font>

    <p> <ul><li><font size="4">Single board computers (SBCs) are used for their compact size, cost-effectiveness, and versatility, making them
        suitable for a wide range of applications from embedded systems and prototyping to education and home projects.
        Their low power consumption and extensive connectivity options further enhance their appeal.</font></li></ul>
